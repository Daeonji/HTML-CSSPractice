                <h1 class = "mainelement">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, emerged in the late 1990s as a solution to the growing complexity of web design. Prior to CSS, styling elements on web pages was primarily done through HTML attributes and tags, leading to cluttered and difficult-to-manage code. In 1994, HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the concept of separating style from structure, which laid the foundation for CSS.</h1>
                <h1 class = "mainelement">The first official version of CSS, CSS1, was published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996. It introduced basic styling capabilities such as font properties, colors, and margins. CSS1 provided a cleaner and more efficient way to control the visual presentation of web pages, but it lacked many features that developers needed for complex designs.</h1>
                <h1 class = "mainelement">Subsequent versions, CSS2 and CSS3, released in 1998 and 1999 respectively, introduced a wealth of new features including positioning, floating elements, and animations. CSS3, still evolving today, introduced modules that allowed for even more granular control over elements and introduced features like media queries for responsive design. The evolution of CSS has played a crucial role in shaping the modern web, enabling designers and developers to create sophisticated and visually appealing websites while maintaining clean and maintainable code.</h1>
